**Ahoy There!**

I'm Philip and am a full stack developer and a 3rd year student @UCI

I am interested in both computer science and design, although I have a special interest in learning about algorithms!

Unfortunately most of my projects are of a sensitve nature and hence are private, however do feel free to contact me if you're interested in my projects.

I'm current looking for a summer internship!

Feel free to connect with me! [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-gudijanto/)
